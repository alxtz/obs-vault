> newsletter endpoint very simple: emails are immediately sent out to all subscribers via Postmark, one API call at a time.

> Newsletter delivery should not be disrupted by transient failures like application crashes, Postmark API errors or network timeouts. To deliver a reliable service in the face of failure we will have to explore new concepts: idempotency, locking, queues and background jobs.

他想介紹不只一個概念
- 幂等性
- locking
- queues
- background jobs

> two identical requests, different idempotency keys = two distinct operations

> two identical requests, same idempotency key = a single operation, the second request is a duplicate;

> two different8 requests, same idempotency key = the first request is processed, the second one is rejected.

**best-effort delivery**

We want to ensure **best-effort delivery**: we strive to deliver the new newsletter issue to all subscribers.  
We cannot _guarantee_ that all emails will be delivered: some accounts might just have been deleted.

At the same time, we should try to minimize duplicates - i.e. a subscriber receiving the same issue multiple times. We cannot rule out duplicates entirely (we will later discuss why), but our implementation should minimize their frequency.
