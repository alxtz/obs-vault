https://stackshare.io/stackups/amazon-elasticache-vs-redis#:~:text=ElastiCache%20supports%20Memcached%20and%20Redis,lists%2C%20sets%20and%20sorted%20sets.

but i had an issue when AWS EOL some of redislabs underlying infra and gave me a potential sev1 scenario

define your own compisite keys, just skip the sql exec
